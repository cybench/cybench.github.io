                            There is a long history of dual-use technology in cybersecurity and there have been extensive discussion of how to weigh the benefits and risks of releasing such technologies. For instance, <a target="_blank"href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/ S0167404813001326.">Silic (2013)</a> surveys practitioners and finds that empirically practitioners agree that dual-use technology has both benefits and harms, as malicious attackers can use them for harm but good actors can use them for defense. 
                            <a target="_blank"href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geojaf16&div=73&id=&page=">Rad (2015)</a> argues that while such technology can be used for harm, restrictions can hinder the benefits of the technology more than the harms, as malicious actors may simply obtain equivalent technology through alternative means such as black markets that are not available to law-abiding actors.
                            <span class="paragraph">
                                Here we acknowledge that the agent and the benchmark are dual-use. In this space, there have been works that have chosen to release their code and others that have chosen to withhold the details of their research. After carefully weighing the benefits and harms of each choice, we have chosen to release our code and data and will explain our reasoning below.
                            </span>
                            <span class="paragraph">
                                In considering the harms, the concern of releasing the agent is that it may be leveraged to identify vulnerabilities and execute exploits on real systems by malicious actors. Current agents are not able to complete difficult cybersecurity tasks which constraints their risks. However, the growing capabilities of LM agents suggests that LM agents may soon substantially outclass non-LM based tools, and thereby unleash harm at a greater magnitude than existing technologies. Here, releasing the framework may accelerate development of stronger cybersecurity agents and expedite this future. Additionally, while there are non-AI tools that can perform similar functions (such as those for automated penetration testing and others explicitly designed for malicious purposes), another potential concern is that AI-based tools such as the agent are non-deterministic and accordingly would be harder to defend from.
                            </span>
                            <span class="paragraph">
                                Next in considering benefits, the agent can be seen as an automated penetration testing tool. Automated penetration testing tools such as <a target="_blank"href="https://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit</a> and <a target="_blank"href="https://owasp.org/www-project-nettacker/">OWASP Nettacker</a> are open source and widely adopted with the awareness that they can be leveraged by malicious actors for attacks because the benefits outweigh the risks. Here, the agent can be likened to an automated penetration testing tool as it identifies vulnerabilities and exploits them. Similarly, the benchmark would encourage development of such tools that have a similar risk-benefit profile to other automated penetration testing tools, and hence be beneficial to release.
                            </span>
                            <span class="paragraph">
                                Additionally, because related works have already openly released their code, any marginal increase in risk would be minimal. For instance, <a target="_blank"href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3611643.3613083">Happe & Cito (2023)</a> release code to leverage LMs for penetration testing, arguing that attackers will use LMs and that defenders would need to prepare to defend with LMs too. Similarly <a target="_blank"href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05590">Shao et al (2024)</a> release code for an agent and a benchmark for CTF tasks after discussing the dual nature of AI as both a tool and a potential threat in cybersecurity. While this work has made distinct contributions, the risk profile of releasing this work is similar, and possibly less than those other works, given that alternative agents and benchmarks already exist.
                            </span>
                            <span class="paragraph">
                                Furthermore, as there has been significant interest and consideration by governments to regulate AI, we critically need more evidence and data for informed decisions and responsible regulation. 
                                There have been many efforts to assess cybersecurity risk, both by government organizations such as the <a target="_blank"href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/advanced-ai-evaluations-may-update">AI Safety Institute</a> and by model providers. By making our work available in a transparent fashion, we can help policy-makers better understand current capabilities and risks of cybersecurity agents, when government often lacks such systematic information.  This evidence should ideally inform responsible regulatory efforts.

                                Finally, as scientific researchers, we believe that reproducibility and transparency are central to the AI ecosystem. The reproducibility crisis affecting the sciences has affected machine learning as well, owing to mistakes and/or even fraud and fabrication. While transparency in code, data, and methods is not sufficient to guarantee reproducibility (as mistakes can, of course, occur in the research process), obscurity can ensure irreproducibility. Additionally, releasing our code allows the community to build upon our work, helping accelerate scientific progress.
